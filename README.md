# Rutherford Backscatering Spectral Analiser

## Rutherford Backscatering
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) is an analytical technique used in materials science. Sometimes referred to as high-energy ion scattering (HEIS) spectrometry, RBS is used to determine the structure and composition of materials by measuring the backscattering of a beam of high energy ions (typically protons or alpha particles) impinging on a sample. 

## Spectral Anlysis using Artificial Neural Network(ANN) 
### Description:
- The inverse RBS problem is to determine from the RBS spectrum data the corresponding sample structures. This process is very time consuming and can only be performed by trained specialists. Using Machine learning we can perform an almost instant classification of the data. 
- The development of this project was done using the Tensorflow and Keras software libraries.

### Requirements: 
- tensorflow (version 2.0 or higher)
- numpy
